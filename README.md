## Current Expedition
I'm architecting a new way in AI-matchmaking, algorithms for human connection. Check out the MVP of my latest venture [here](https://indradevai.replit.app/).

## Cognitive Expansion
I'm currently deep-diving into the world of Pythonic AI (OpenAI), ML (PyTorch) and NLP (spaCy) in matchmaking, expanding my horizons to bring more PLEASURrrererer experiences to you.

## Engage with Me
Talk to me about AI, advertising, science, love, about the synergy of humans and technology, and how we can co-create a future that resonates with both.

## Connect
